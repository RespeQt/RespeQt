	<h1><img src="/icons/main-icon/RespeQt.png" align="middle"/>&nbsp;RespeQt, Atari Serial Peripheral Emulator for Qt</h1>
	
	<p align="justify"><b>Summary</b><br />RespeQt emulates Atari SIO peripherals when connected to an Atari 8-bit computer with an SIO2PC cable. 
	In that respect t's similar to programs like APE, Atari810, and AspeQt. The main difference is that it's free (unlike 
	APE and AspeQt) and it's cross-platform (unlike Atari810 and APE).</p>
	
	<b>Some features</b>
	
	<ul type="square">
		<li>Qt based GUI with drag and drop support.</li>
		<li>Cross-platform <em>(Windows, Linux, OSX)</em></li>
		<li>15 disk drive emulation <em>(drives 9-15 are only supported by SpartaDOS X)</em></li>
		<li>Text-only printer emulation with saving and printing of the output</li>
		<li>Cassette image playback</li>
		<li>Folders can be mounted as simulated Dos20s disks. <em>(read-only, now with SDX compatibility, and bootable)</em></li>
		<li>Atari executables can be booted directly, optionally with high speed.</li>
		<li>Contents of image files can be viewed / changed</li>
		<li>AspeQt Client module ASPECL.COM. Runs on the Atari and is used to get/set Date/Time on the Atari plus a variety of other remote tasks.</li>
		<li>ApeTime client support.</li>
		<li>Up to 6xSIO speed and more if the serial port adaptor supports it <em>(FTDI chip based cables are recommanded).</em></li>
		<li>Localization support (Currently for English, German, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish and Turkish). ***this may be broken***</li>
		<li>Multi-session support</li>
	</ul>
